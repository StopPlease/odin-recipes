            <li>Saute sliced onion and mushrooms in 2 tablespoons olive oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and zucchini to the skillet. Cover, and cook until spinach is wilted, 2 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce in the prepared baking dish. Place a layer of noodles on top of the tomato sauce; spread all of the ricotta mixture onto the noodles. Place another layer of noodles on top of the ricotta mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour about 2 cups tomato sauce onto the noodles; arrange all of the sauteed vegetables on top of the sauce. Top vegetables with noodles and spread the remaining tomato sauce over the final layer of noodles. Top with mozzarella cheese slices and 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and cheese is melted and beginning to brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool 10 minutes before serving.</li>
